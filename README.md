# track_generator
Generates an image with a car track. This can be used to make the grount of 3D race simulations

The circuit_cente generator will use a set of textures to construct a randomized ground image, then it will draw the track on the ground image.
The set of textures are stored in the texture folder.

the circuit array definition is an array of positions : [ axis_center_x, axis_center_y,R1,R2,]
